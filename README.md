general Assembley pre work course

This is a simple game of rock paper scissors created using the information given to me through general assembly's pre course work where I did some self studying and was able to 
adapt the information given to me to create a game of rock paper scissors which included my own basic character.

The features in this game can do with some refining and perfecting, but given what I have studied and learnt, it shows good progress and gives me a platform where I can state
that I have actually learnt the information they have given.

I wish to develop this project to make sure that it is as efficicent as possible. Currently I have created my own computer character but wish to change and adapt things to make
everything more personalised!

1) Make there sets which states whether computer has won or not.
2) Make the transitions between winning and losing better, making the website more resnpsove and appealing.
3) Change the background block colors to a more texturised look for it.

You may have seen that some of the designs have already been done/changed!
